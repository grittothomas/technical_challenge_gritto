STEP 1: Create VPC

AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the VPC service.
Create a new VPC with an CIDR block.
Set up IPv4.

STEP 2: Create Subnets

Create public and private subnets in different availability zones.
Public subnets will host resources like load balancers and instances with public IP addresses.
Private subnets will host instances that don't need direct internet access.

STEP 3: Setting up the Internet Gateway
Create an internet gateway and attach it to your VPC.
Configure route tables to direct traffic from public subnets to the internet gateway.

STEP 4: Create the NAT Gateway
Create a NAT gateway in a public subnet.
Configure route tables for private subnets to route outbound traffic through the NAT gateway.

STEP 5: Add Route Tables
Create separate route tables for public and private subnets.
Associate appropriate subnets with each route table.
Define routes in route tables to control traffic flow.

STEP 6: Configure the Launch Templates
Create launch templates with configuration settings for your instances.
Include instance type, AMI, security groups, and other settings.
Use user data scripts to automate instance setup during launch.

Provision the template for simple html page:

#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable https
echo "<html><body><h1>Gritto Website for 3Tier Application</h1>
</body></html>">/var/www/html/index.html


STEP 7: Auto Scaling Groups
Create auto scaling groups to automatically manage the number of instances.
Define scaling policies based on metrics like CPU utilization or request count.

STEP 8: Database Tier
Set up a separate database layer using Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora for PostgreSQL Databases.
Configure security groups.
Update application configurations to connect to the database tier.
